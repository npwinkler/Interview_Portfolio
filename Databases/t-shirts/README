/* T-Shirt Sales Database Design, Implementation, and Usage */
When ordering shirts for my house's t-shirt sales, I used Google Forms to collect orders, imported the data into a .csv, and 
then designed a SQLite database to be able to handle that data. After having designed and populated the database, I 
used SQL to perform functions such as automatically rather than manually finding how many shirts of each color and size 
combination I needed to order as well as checked for null values and improper input to be able to re-contact the right people.
