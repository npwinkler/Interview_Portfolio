Here is a word doc of 2 analyses that I performed for my STAT 234: Statistical Models and Methods class. The first one
is investigating gas usages, both in terms of their central tendencies and variabilities, in houses over the course of a year.

The second is investigating the difference in chick weights based on the diets they were fed. In particular, the information
given was not enough to justify the assumptions necessary in order to perform an ANOVA test, so drawing conclusions from a
visualization process was more appropriate.
